  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <h3>Greenhaven Place (Sacramento) Summer 2022</h3>
  <p> The first job I ever had occured during the summer of 2022. I was a <em>concierge</em> at this independent
      and assisted living for seniors.
      
      <br></br> At this job, I worked at the front desk where I greeted residents and visitors entering the premises. I was in charge of making sure visitors
      signed in and would help them with their needs. I would also maintained the office space and
      our copy room keeping them properly clean and organized.
       I made sure to follow my daily assigned tasks. This was an
      amazing first job oppurtunity
      to have and I am thankful they gave me a chance to experience it.
  </p>
  <h3>UWP Writing Program (Davis) 1 Year 2023 </h3>
  <p>A more recent occurence, I became a student assistant for the UWP Writing Program in 2023 located in the basement
      of the Peter J. Shields Library based on the UC Davis Campus. My duties and tasks were similar to
      Greenhaven Place where I'd greet visitors and keep the office space maintained for the lecturers and professors
      that shared the office.
       Once again, I am thankful for this position and hope I
      can only grow and learn more.
  </p>

  <h3>Transit Driver for Unitrans (Davis) 2 Years</h3>
  <p>Not to long after being hired for the UWP Writing Program, I was surprised to learn that I was also hired by Unitrans to become a Transit Driver 
      for the company. I thought I had blown my interview. And yet, for what started off as a joke and a small posibility for me quickly expanded and grew into a new passion.
      After a quick summer break in Puerto Vallarta, I returned to Davis to learn how to drive a bus with my driver trainer, mentor, and now friend, Alfredo. 
  </p>
  I was also able to make new friends and acquaintances, something I wasn't quite able to do during my somewhat isolated desk jobs.
   But best of all, I unlocked a new rare achievement in my life, aka whip a bus!
  </p>

  Just kidding! (But not really! That was a real email I received!)

</p>
I eventually leveled up enough to learn how to drive the vintage London Double Decker! One of a couple of original vintage busses that don't run anywhere else!
