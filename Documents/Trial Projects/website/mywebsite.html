        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Liew Jade Saefong and I just turned 20! I am a she/her Mien-American first generation second-year student.
            I am the youngest of six daughters.
        </p>
        <h3>Majors</h3>
        <p>
            I started college off with the intent to go into medicine. That being said, I entered UC Davis with the
            intention to
            become a doctor and that soon changed after I experienced my first stem classes that quarter. To put it
            simply,
            I sucked terribly. I quickly looked for a different major and I stumbled upon computer science, with the help of
            my
            sisters and brother-in-law. Last year, he brought us to tour his work campus, the holy LinkedIn. It was
            quite amazing
            and seemed like a location that only appeared in movies. And yet, there I stood with the possibility and
            new found goal to make my way there.
        </p>
        <p>
            To summarize, I am considering:
            <li>Computer Science</li>
            <li>Cognitive Science</li>
            <li>Design</li>
        </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Recently, I have picked up many different hobbies. I like to listen to music (especially pop), to read,
            to crochet, and build legos. Unfortunately for me, these hobbies tend to cost a decent chunk of money.

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Greenhaven Place (Sacramento)</h3>
        <p> This was my first job that I ever had it occured during the summer of 2022. My position at this independent
            and assisted livign
            facility was that of a <em>concierge</em>. Quite a fancy term for receptionist, I would dare say.
            <br></br> At this job, I worked at the front desk where I greeted residents and visitors. For visitors, I
            would have
            them sign in their name and who they're visiting as a precaution. I would keep the office space clean and
            our copy room nice
            while also making sure that things were running smoothly and following my daily assigned tasks. This was an
            amazing first job
            to have and I am thankful they gave me an oppurtunity to experience it.
        </p>
        <h3>UWP Writing Program (Davis)</h3>
        <p>A more recent occurence, I became a student assistant for the UWP Writing Program located in the basement
            of the Peter J. Shields Library located on the UC Davis Campus. My duties and tasks were similar to
            Greenhaven Place
            as it was just another variation of a receptionist. Once again, I am thankful for this position and hope I
            can learn more.
