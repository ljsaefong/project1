        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Liew Jade Saefong and I will be turning 22 in less than 2 weeks! I am a she/her, Mien-American first generation fourth-year student.
            Funfact, I am the youngest of six daughters! I also love food and building legos.
        </p>
        <h3>Majors</h3>
        <p>
            I entered college with the intent to go into medicine. I wanted to become a doctor which changed shortly after I experienced my first round of stem classes. To put it
            simply,
           It was a disaster. I quickly looked for altenrative options and I stumbled upon computer science, with the egging on of
            my
            sisters and brother-in-law. I was unconvinved until he had brought us on a tour of his work campus--LinkedIn in the Silicon Valley. It was
            phenomenal
            and seemed like something you would only see in the movies. There I stood with the newfound possibility of it being me.
        <p>
            To summarize, I am considering:
            <li>Computer Science</li>
            <li>Cognitive Science</li>
            <li>Design</li>
        </p>
            
       Side Note: My updated college major arc is Biological Sciences -> Cognitive Science -> Computer Science. TBD. Update: Still going "strong"

        
        </p>
        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Recently, I have picked up many different hobbies. I like to listen to music (especially pop), read,
             crochet, and build legos. I also love trying out new restuarants and playing videogames! (Unfortunately for me, these hobbies tend to cost a decent chunk of money.)
        </p>

    <div id="Work Experience">
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3>Greenhaven Place (Sacramento) Summer 2022</h3>
        <p> This was my first job that I ever had it occured during the summer of 2022. My position at this independent
            and assisted living
            facility was that of a <em>concierge</em>. 
            <br></br> At this job, I worked at the front desk where I greeted residents and visitors entering the premises. I was in charge of making sure visitors
            signed in and would help them with their needs. I would also maintained the office space and
            our copy room keeping them properly clean and organized.
             I made sure to follow my daily assigned tasks. This was an
            amazing first job oppurtunity
            to have and I am thankful they gave me a chance to experience it.
        </p>
        <h3>UWP Writing Program (Davis) 1 Year</h3>
        <p>A more recent occurence, I became a student assistant for the UWP Writing Program in 2023 located in the basement
            of the Peter J. Shields Library based on the UC Davis Campus. My duties and tasks were similar to
            Greenhaven Place where I'd greet visitors and keep the office space maintained for the lecturers and professors
            that shared the office.
             Once again, I am thankful for this position and hope I
            can only grow and learn more.
        </p>

        <h3>Transit Driver for Unitrans (Davis) 2 Years</h3>
        <p>Not to long after being hired for the UWP Writing Program, I was surprised to learn that I was also hired by Unitrans to become a Transit Driver 
            for the company. I thought I had blown my interview. And yet, for what started off as a joke and a small posibility for me quickly expanded and grew into a new passion.
            After a quick summer break in Puerto Vallarta, I returned to Davis to learn how to drive a bus with my driver trainer, mentor, and now friend, Alfredo. 
        </p>
        I was also able to make new friends and acquaintances, something I wasn't quite able to do during my somewhat isolated desk jobs.
         But best of all, I unlocked a new rare achievement in my life, aka whip a bus!

        Just kidding! (But not really! That was a real email I received!)

    </p>
    I eventually leveled up enough to learn how to drive the vintage London Double Decker! One of a couple of original vintage busses that don't run anywhere else!
